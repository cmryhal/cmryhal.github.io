## BIOGRAPHY

I was born and raised in Northern Virginia and have lived in Lusby, Maryland; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and now, Iwakuni, Japan.  I am a active duty Navy spouse and have 1 child and 3 bonus-children.  I am a full-time student and have been working on my degree for the past 10 plus years.  Before getting married five years ago, I worked in Defense Contracting as a Business Development Analyst and Proposal Support Specialist.  Most of my time is spent trying to be the best mother and wife I can be, while going to school to hopefully help ensure a good future for my family!  I used to enjoy horseback riding, specifically, dressage, but try to avoid injury as much as possible these days so I can be here for my family.  My husband will be retiring in 4 years or so and we are looking forward to our next adventure!
