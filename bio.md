## BIOGRAPHY

I was born and raised in Northern Virginia and have lived in Lusby, Maryland; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and now, Iwakuni, Japan.  I am a Navy active duty spouse and have 1 child and 3 bonus-children.  I am a full-time student and have been working on my degree for the past 10 plus years.  Before getting married five years ago, I worked in Defense Contracting as a Business Development Analyst and Proposal Support Specialist.  Most of my time is spent trying to be the best mother and wife I can be, while going to school to hopefully help ensure a good future for my family.
