## Special Topic - Dressage

Dressage is an equestrian sport that is similar to English style horseback riding.  It is a highly skilled form of riding that is almost artistic where the horse performs many different movements as directed by the rider.  Competitions are held at the Olympic level, but I only rode for personal enjoyment and because I love horses.  What is nice about dressage riding is that you can really interact with the horse.  The saddle is thinner than a western saddle, so the horse can feel your body weight and leg movements that he/she is trained to recognize and move based on.  For instance, when your squeeze your calf muscles around the horse, he/she understands to move into a walk, trot, canter or run.  If you squeeze your knees into the shoulder blades while pulling back on the reigns, that signals him/her to stop.  The reigns are also always kept tight at the bit (mouth), whereas in western riding, the reigns are loose.  Dressage is a very beautiful form of horseback riding that I’m sure everyone would enjoy watching.  It’s amazing to see how the horse and rider interact and how well the horse can respond to certain directions.
